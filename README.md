# Microprocessors-Part1
This is a partof  my Projects for my Uni lesson "Microprocessors"

## Monte Carlo and Logic Gate Activity Simulations
This project includes implementations of Monte Carlo simulations and switching activity analysis for logic gates and digital circuits. All components are combined into a single file for ease of management and execution.

## Ask1 – Monte Carlo and Logic Gate Simulation

### 1.1 Monte Carlo Estimation of π

A classical Monte Carlo method implementation to approximate the numerical value of π by sampling random points inside a unit circle.

### 1.2 Switching Activity of a 4-Input OR Gate

A Monte Carlo-based program that calculates the switching activity (probability of output change) of a 4-input OR gate based on random input patterns.

### 1.3 Signal Probabilities with `signalprobs.m`

A MATLAB function that calculates the signal probabilities for basic logic gates. The file includes sections for code completion or extension.

## Ask2 – Circuit Analysis and Monte Carlo

### 2.1 Circuit Creation

Implementation and description of a combinational digital circuit using arrays or functions.

### 2.2 Switching Activity in the Circuit
  
Analysis of circuit's switching activity.

### 2.3 Monte Carlo Circuit Simulation

Application of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate circuit behavior under random inputs.

## Ask3 – Testbench Creation

This task includes three parts:

1. Generation of random or controlled input vectors.
2. Application of the vectors to the circuit.
3. Analysis of outputs and performance evaluation.

The implementation simulates the role of a testbench for digital design verification.

## Ask4 – Stress Test Generation Using a Genetic Algorithm

Generation of input vectors that produce maximal switching activity in the circuit using a genetic algorithm. The goal is to create maximum load scenarios for testing and reliability assessment.
