This is a partof  my Projects for my Uni lesson "Microprocessors"

## Monte Carlo and Logic Gate Activity Simulations
This project is about Monte Carlo simulations and switching activity analysis for logic gates and digital circuits.

## Lab 1 – Monte Carlo and Logic Gate Simulation

### 1.1 Monte Carlo Estimation of π

A Monte Carlo method for the numerical value of π by sampling random points inside a unit circle.

### 1.2 Switching Activity of a 4-Input OR Gate

A Monte Carlo-based program that calculates the switching activity of circuit, on random input patterns.

### 1.3 Signal Probabilities with `signalprobs.m`

A function that calculates the signal probabilities for basic logic gates.

## Lab 2 – Circuit Analysis and Monte Carlo

### 2.1 Circuit Creation

Implementation and description of a combinational digital circuit using arrays or functions.

### 2.2 Switching Activity in the Circuit
  
Analysis of circuit's switching activity.

### 2.3 Monte Carlo Circuit Simulation

Application of Monte Carlo simulation to estimate circuit behavior under random inputs.
